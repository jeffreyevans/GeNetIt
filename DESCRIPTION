Description: Implementation of spatial graph-theoretic genetic gravity models.
    The model framework is applicable for other types of spatial flow questions.
    Includes functions for constructing spatial graphs, sampling and summarizing
    associated raster variables and building unconstrained and singly constrained
    gravity models.
