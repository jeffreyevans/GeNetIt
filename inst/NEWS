  evaluating competing models

GeNetIt_0.1-2
=================
* Added function "compare.models" to evaluate competing models

* Added function "flow" to coerce distance matrices to flow

* Depreciated area.graph.statistics, added this functionality to graph.statistics with buffer argument 

* Changed graph.statistics to leverage velox extraction, orders of magnitude faster
